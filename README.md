## Artstyle

Kind of like this:

The rule of thumb is
> Low Poly but not Blocky

Textures should be appropriate in how detailed they are. And they should be the "clean" state of the object, unless the object is really always going to be weathered. Any dirt and filth will be added as needed or dynamically with decals in the game.

## Assets

Assets like Walls, Stairs, Fences, Roofs, etc. should be designed as modular as possible, so that they are easy to reuse, which includes consistency in dimensions (e.g. making sure the width and height of a wall falls on a multiple of 5, so 1.5m or .25m or anything like that).

Leaves of foliage should consist of two-sided Planes.

Assets should be exported as FBX files.
